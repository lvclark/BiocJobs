# Contributing to BiocJobs

Thanks for helping. BiocJobs is a small package with a strict contract: a
job specification is the single source of truth, and everything else —
the runtime `--name value` command line, the Galaxy/TES/Nextflow/WDL
artifacts, the manifest — is derived from it. Contributions are easiest to
review when they keep that direction of flow.

## Setup

You need R (>= 4.6.0) and the package dependencies:

```r
install.packages(c("yaml", "jsonlite", "xml2"))            # Imports
install.packages(c("testthat", "knitr", "rmarkdown"))      # Suggests
BiocManager::install("BiocStyle")                          # vignette
```

Then install the package from a source checkout:

```bash
R CMD INSTALL .
```

Optional, only needed to check generated artifacts against the tools that
consume them: `xmllint` (libxml2), `miniwdl` and `nextflow` — CI installs
these three, so you can also just let CI do it — plus `planemo` if you
want to lint or run the Galaxy wrapper the way Galaxy's tool developers
do.

## Running the tests

```r
testthat::test_local()          # from the package root
```

or the full check the way CI runs it:

```bash
R CMD build . && R CMD check BiocJobs_*.tar.gz
Rscript -e 'BiocCheck::BiocCheck(getwd(), `new-package` = TRUE)'
```

The suite needs no network and no Bioconductor experiment data. The `toy`
example package shipped at `inst/examples/toy` is the fixture for anything
that must exercise a real job end to end — prefer it over inventing a new
one, and reach for `examples/DESeq2` only for documentation.

## Generated artifacts are never hand-edited

Everything under `examples/DESeq2/generated/` (and `exec/`) is generator
output. If an artifact is wrong, fix the generator or the specification and
regenerate — a hand-edit is silently reverted by the next regeneration and
CI will reject it.

Regenerate from the repository root, with BiocJobs installed:

```bash
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' validate examples/DESeq2
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' tes      examples/DESeq2 deseq2-differential-expression --out examples/DESeq2/generated/deseq2-differential-expression.tes.json
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' galaxy   examples/DESeq2 deseq2-differential-expression --out examples/DESeq2/generated/deseq2_differential_expression.xml
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' nextflow examples/DESeq2 deseq2-differential-expression --out examples/DESeq2/generated/deseq2_differential_expression.nf
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' wdl      examples/DESeq2 deseq2-differential-expression --out examples/DESeq2/generated/deseq2_differential_expression.wdl
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' manifest examples/DESeq2 --out examples/DESeq2/generated/manifest.json
```

`exec/DESeq2.R` is regenerated separately with
`BiocExecute::execCompile('examples/DESeq2')`, which needs the BiocExecute
`feat/biocjobs-specs` branch; CI therefore skips that one step. Refresh it
by hand when the job interface changes.

Note that the artifacts embed the BiocJobs version, so bumping `Version:`
in `DESCRIPTION` makes them stale: regenerate in the same commit.

Roxygen documentation is generated too — edit the roxygen comments in
`R/`, then `roxygen2::roxygenise()`; never edit `man/*.Rd` or `NAMESPACE`
directly.

## What CI enforces

Two workflows run on every push and pull request to `main`
(`.github/workflows/`):

- **check** — `R CMD check` via `rcmdcheck` with `error_on = "warning"`,
  then ``BiocCheck::BiocCheck(getwd(), `new-package` = TRUE)``, both inside
  `bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:devel`. Warnings are failures.
- **artifacts** — regenerates every artifact of the DESeq2 example and
  fails on `git diff --exit-code` (stale committed output) or on a
  generated file that was never committed; then validates each artifact
  against the schema of the system that consumes it: the Galaxy tool XSD
  (`xmllint --schema`), the GA4GH TES 1.1 `tesTask` schema
  (`.github/scripts/validate-tes-task.py`, which also checks the
  create-task rules), `miniwdl check`, and `nextflow lint`.

A red **artifacts** run almost always means "you changed a generator or a
spec and did not commit the regenerated files".

## Code style

- 4-space indent, no tabs; lines under 80 columns.
- No `<<-`; no assignment into the global environment, and no `library()`
  or `require()` calls inside package code.
- `snake_case` for local variables, `camelCase` for exported functions,
  a leading `.` for internal helpers (`.wdlType()`, `.nfVar()`).
- Every exported function is roxygen-documented with a runnable
  `@examples` block; internal files start with a short comment explaining
  what the file is for and why it is shaped that way.
- Comments explain intent (especially escaping and cross-language quoting
  rules, which are the subtle part of this package), not mechanics.
- No new hard dependencies without discussion; `Imports:` is deliberately
  four packages.

## Adding a new generator

`R/nextflow.R` and `R/wdl.R` are the two smallest complete generators —
read them first; a CWL or Snakemake target is the same shape. A generator
is a pure function of a `BiocJob` object that returns text and optionally
writes it to `file`; it must not run the job, read the environment, or
touch anything outside the spec.

Touch points for a new target `foo`:

1. `R/foo.R` — the generator, exported as `fooTask()`/`fooModule()`,
   plus internal helpers for that language's identifier and string
   escaping rules. Emit the canonical command
   (`Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::execJob("pkg", "job")' --flag value`); never
   invent a second calling convention.
2. `NAMESPACE` / `man/` — via roxygen (`roxygen2::roxygenise()`).
3. `R/cli.R` — add the subcommand to `.CLI_USAGE`, to the allowed-command
   vector in `.cliDispatch()`, and to the generator branch of the
   `switch()`.
4. `tests/testthat/test-wdl-nextflow.R` (or a new `test-foo.R`) — cover
   the happy path plus the escaping edge cases: quotes and backslashes in
   labels, reserved words as option names, a name starting with a digit,
   boolean and choice options, absent defaults.
5. Docs — `README.md`, `docs/developer-guide.md` (Step 7), and the
   `examples/DESeq2` README table; then regenerate the example artifacts
   and commit them.
6. `.github/workflows/artifacts.yaml` — add a generation command and a
   validation step using that ecosystem's own linter, so the new artifact
   is guarded like the others.

## Bugs, and changes to the specification

Open an issue at
<https://github.com/Bioconductor/BiocJobs/issues>. For a bug, include the
job YAML (or a minimal version of it), the exact command, and the full
error message; specification bugs are much easier to fix from the YAML
than from a description.

Changes to the specification format itself are the highest-cost changes
here, because every declared job in every package is written against it.
Propose them as an issue before opening a pull request, and say what a
maintainer with an existing spec has to do. The format carries a version:
`.SPEC_VERSION` in `R/spec.R`, matched against the `biocjobs:` field of
every spec.

- Additive, optional fields: no version bump; document the field, add
  validation for it, and make sure a spec without it behaves as before.
- Anything that would invalidate, or silently change the meaning of, an
  existing spec: bump `.SPEC_VERSION`, and describe the migration in
  `NEWS.md`.

New option types, new `format:` entries in `jobFormats()`, and new
resource fields are all specification changes — they have to be mapped
onto *every* target, so include the generator updates in the same pull
request.
