# BiocJobs developer guide: making your package dispatchable

This guide walks a Bioconductor package maintainer through declaring
dispatchable jobs in a package, from an empty directory to generated,
validated wrappers for Galaxy, GA4GH TES, Nextflow, WDL, and an optional
command-line interface. Every step shows real commands and their output.
The running example throughout is the DESeq2 declaration shipped in
[`examples/DESeq2/`](../examples/DESeq2/).

**The short version.** You add two files under `inst/biocjobs/` — a YAML
file declaring what your analysis needs, produces, and exposes, and a plain
R script that does it. Everything else (wrappers, CLIs, registry entries)
is generated. Nothing else about your package changes.

## 1. Concepts

A **job** is one complete, non-interactive unit of analysis your package
can perform: files in, files out, parameters known up front, no human in
the loop.

Each job consists of exactly two files in your package source tree:

```
mypackage/
└── inst/
    └── biocjobs/
        ├── my-analysis.yaml        <- the SPECIFICATION (interface)
        └── scripts/
            └── my-analysis.R       <- the SCRIPT (implementation)
```

The **specification** declares the job's interface: input files and their
formats, output files and their formats, typed configuration options,
resource needs, runtime dependencies, citations, and test cases. It is the
single source of truth — machine-readable without evaluating any R code,
which is what lets build infrastructure enumerate and validate every job
in a tarball safely.

The **script** is plain R. Its first line hands control of the interface
to the specification:

```r
params <- BiocJobs::jobParams("mypackage", "my-analysis")
```

`jobParams()` parses the command line *against the declaration* — type
coercion, defaults, choice validation, required checks, output directory
creation — and returns a named list. The rest of the script is analysis
code reading `params$<name>`.

The **runtime contract** ties everything together: every input, output,
and option is passed as a `--name value` command-line pair, and every
execution environment launches the same self-locating command:

```
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::execJob("mypackage", "my-analysis")' --name value ...
```

From the declaration, BiocJobs **generates**:

| Target | Artifact | Consumed by |
|---|---|---|
| Galaxy | tool wrapper XML + staged `test-data/` | Galaxy servers, `planemo test` |
| GA4GH TES | task template JSON | Funnel, TESK, cloud TES endpoints |
| Nextflow | DSL2 module (`process` with typed inputs, `emit:` outputs, stub) | Nextflow / nf-core pipelines |
| WDL | task (WDL 1.0, `parameter_meta`, runtime) | Cromwell, miniwdl, Terra, dxWDL |
| Manifest | JSON summary of all jobs | registry aggregation, build infra |
| CLI | Rapp application (via BiocExecute) | humans at a shell |

## 2. Is my package a good candidate?

Declare a job when the analysis is **batch-shaped**:

- inputs are files (or can reasonably be serialized to files),
- outputs are files,
- every decision a user makes can be expressed as a typed option up front,
- the code path runs unattended from start to finish.

Good fits: differential expression, normalization, peak calling, denoising,
quantification import, batch correction, deconvolution, annotation.

Poor fits: interactive visualization, iterative model tuning with a human
in the loop, browsers, anything requiring a live R session mid-analysis.
Packages like that simply don't add `inst/biocjobs/` — opting out is the
default.

One package can declare **several** jobs (e.g. one per major workflow), and
a job does not need to expose everything a function can do: expose the
parameters that matter for batch use, hard-code sensible choices for the
rest, and keep the full flexibility in your R API.

## 3. Step 1 — scaffold

With BiocJobs installed, from your package source directory:

```r
BiocJobs::jobSkeleton("my-analysis")
```

```
created inst/biocjobs/my-analysis.yaml
created inst/biocjobs/scripts/my-analysis.R
next: edit both files, then validate with
  Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' validate .
```

The two files are working templates: the YAML demonstrates every
specification field with comments, and the script demonstrates the
contract. Existing files are never overwritten (pass `overwrite = TRUE` if
you mean it).

## 4. Step 2 — write the specification

The complete field reference. Fields marked *(required)* make
`validateJob()` fail when absent; everything else has a sensible default
or is optional.

### Top level

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `biocjobs` *(required)* | Spec format version. Currently `"1.0"`. |
| `name` *(required)* | Job identifier, `[a-z0-9][a-z0-9._-]*`. Appears in artifact names, CLI subcommands, tags. Prefer dashes (`deseq2-differential-expression`); see the CLI naming note below. |
| `package` *(required)* | Your package name, exactly as in `DESCRIPTION`. |
| `title` *(required)* | One line, human-readable. Becomes the Galaxy tool name and CLI title. |
| `tagline` | Very short description for tool listings (Galaxy `<description>`). |
| `description` | A paragraph. Reused in every generated artifact's help. |
| `version` | Job version (semver string). Drives wrapper versioning — bump it whenever the interface or the script's behavior changes. |
| `license` | SPDX license for generated wrappers (default `MIT`). |
| `script` *(required)* | Script path relative to `inst/biocjobs/`. |
| `depends` | R packages the *script* needs beyond your package and its hard dependencies — typically `Suggests` used at runtime (e.g. `[apeglm, ashr]` for DESeq2's shrinkage options). Drives TES bootstrap installs. |
| `container` | Override the default container image for this job. |

**CLI naming note:** a job name becomes a CLI subcommand by mapping `-` to
`_` internally (and back for display), so `my-analysis` is fine, but names
where that mapping produces an invalid R name (e.g. a reserved word like
`if`, or `2pass-align` after mapping) cannot be exposed by the CLI layer.
`validateJob()` emits a note when that happens.

### `inputs` — files the job consumes

```yaml
inputs:
  - name: counts          # flag: --counts <path>. ^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$
    format: tsv           # from BiocJobs::jobFormats(); drives Galaxy
                          # datatypes and container file extensions
    label: Raw count matrix          # short; UI form labels
    help: >                          # long; UI help, WDL parameter_meta
      Tab-separated matrix of raw integer counts, first column gene ids.
    # required: false     # inputs are required unless you say otherwise
```

Run `BiocJobs::jobFormats()` for the format vocabulary (`tsv`, `csv`,
`rds`, `fasta`, `fastq`, `bam`, `vcf`, `pdf`, ...). Unknown formats are
allowed — they pass through verbatim to generators — but validation flags
them as notes so typos get caught.

### `outputs` — files the job must produce

```yaml
outputs:
  - name: results
    format: tsv
    label: Differential expression results
    help: Per-gene table ordered by adjusted p-value.
```

Every declared output **must** be written by the script, to the path in
`params$<name>`. The local runner warns when a declared output was not
produced; engines treat it as job failure.

### `options` — typed configuration

```yaml
options:
  - name: shrinkage
    type: choice                 # boolean | choice | string | integer | float
    choices: [apeglm, ashr, normal, none]
    default: apeglm
    label: Log2 fold change shrinkage
    help: apeglm is the recommended default.

  - name: alpha
    type: float
    default: 0.1
    min: 0                       # bounds (integer/float): jobParams()
    max: 1                       # enforces them at run time; Galaxy/WDL show them
    label: FDR threshold

  - name: contrast_factor
    type: string
    required: true               # no default -> user must supply
    label: Factor to test

  - name: design
    type: string
    default: "~ condition"
    allow_chars: ["~"]           # extend Galaxy's text sanitizer; see below
    label: Design formula

  - name: prefilter
    type: boolean
    default: true
    label: Pre-filter low-count genes
```

Rules worth knowing:

- Every option needs either a `default` or `required: true` — validation
  enforces this so generated forms are never silently incomplete.
- Inputs, outputs, and options share **one** flag namespace; duplicate
  names across sections are validation errors.
- `allow_chars` matters for string options holding R formulas: Galaxy's
  default text sanitizer strips characters like `~`, which would silently
  corrupt `~ condition` into `condition`. Declaring
  `allow_chars: ["~"]` makes the generated wrapper extend the sanitizer.
- Booleans arrive in your script as R logicals; integers as integers;
  floats as doubles; choice values are validated against `choices` before
  your script sees them.

### `resources` — scheduling hints

```yaml
resources:
  cpus: 1
  memory_gb: 4
  disk_gb: 10
```

These map to TES `resources`, Nextflow `cpus`/`memory`/`disk` directives,
and WDL `runtime`. Estimate for a typical dataset; engines can override.

### `citations`

```yaml
citations:
  - doi: 10.1186/s13059-014-0550-8
```

Rendered as Galaxy `<citations>`; carried in manifests. Cite your method
paper and the papers behind optional methods your job exposes.

### `tests` — see [Step 6](#8-step-6--declare-wrapper-tests).

## 5. Step 3 — write the script

The script template from `jobSkeleton()` is the contract in miniature:

```r
params <- BiocJobs::jobParams("mypackage", "my-analysis")

data <- read.delim(params$input1)
result <- ...                                   # real work
write.table(result, params$output1, sep = "\t",
            quote = FALSE, row.names = FALSE)
```

The rules, all of which exist because some engine depends on them:

1. **First line is `jobParams()`.** After it returns, every value is typed,
   validated, and defaulted. Do not read `commandArgs()` yourself; do not
   add your own defaults downstream (they would drift from the spec that
   generated the UI the user saw).
2. **Fail loudly, early, and specifically.** `stop()` with a message that
   names the offending input and says how to fix it. Non-zero exit is how
   every engine detects failure (`detect_errors="exit_code"` in Galaxy,
   executor exit codes in TES, task failure in Nextflow/WDL).
3. **Never prompt, never open interactive devices**, never `browser()`,
   never assume a display. `pdf(file)` is fine; `plot()` to a default
   device is not.
4. **Write every declared output**, exactly to `params$<name>`.
5. **Log to stderr** with `message()` — engines capture it as the job log.
   A `sessionInfo()` at the end gives every run provenance for free.
6. **Validate scientific preconditions defensively.** Batch users can't
   see your data structures. The DESeq2 example script is the reference
   here — it checks, with named errors, for: non-numeric counts, NA cells,
   duplicate gene identifiers, samples missing from the annotation, factor
   levels that DESeq2 would silently rename (non-syntactic names), and
   contrast levels that don't exist. Read it before writing yours:
   [`deseq2-differential-expression.R`](../examples/DESeq2/inst/biocjobs/scripts/deseq2-differential-expression.R).
7. **Read TSV/CSV robustly**: `read.delim(..., quote = "", comment.char = "")`
   unless your format genuinely uses quoting — a stray `"` in an identifier
   otherwise swallows rows silently.
8. Package your script's *extra* runtime dependencies in `depends:` —
   anything in your package's `Suggests` that the script actually loads.

## 6. Step 4 — run it locally

The local runner executes the job in a fresh `Rscript` process from your
source checkout — no installation needed, same contract as production:

```bash
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' run . my-analysis \
    --input1 test-data/input1.tsv \
    --method fast
```

```
workdir: /tmp/biocjob_1a2b3c
output output1: /tmp/biocjob_1a2b3c/output1.tsv
```

Or from R: `runJob(readJob("inst/biocjobs/my-analysis.yaml"),
params = list(input1 = "..."))`.

Test the failure paths too — a missing required flag, a wrong choice value,
a malformed input file. Each should produce one clear error line, because
that line is what a Galaxy or Nextflow user will see in their job log.

## 7. Step 5 — validate

```bash
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' validate .
```

```
all job specifications valid
```

`validate` exits non-zero on errors, so wire it into your CI next to
`R CMD check`. **Errors** (missing fields, bad option types, defaults not
among choices, duplicate flag names, missing script, no outputs) make the
job unusable. **Notes** (no label, unknown format, CLI-incompatible name,
missing test files) are advisory but worth fixing before release.

## 8. Step 6 — declare wrapper tests

```yaml
tests:
  - inputs:
      counts: test-data/counts.tsv        # relative to your package root
      coldata: test-data/coldata.tsv
    options:
      contrast_factor: condition
      contrast_numerator: treated
      contrast_denominator: control
    outputs:
      results:
        file: test-data/results.tsv       # expected output
        compare: sim_size                 # size comparison with tolerance
        delta: 3000
      ma_plot: {}                         # just assert it exists/non-empty
```

These become `<tests>` in the Galaxy wrapper, and the referenced files are
staged into `test-data/` next to the generated XML — exactly the layout
`planemo test` expects. Keep test data tiny (the DESeq2 example simulates
600 genes × 6 samples with a fixed seed; the generator script is committed
next to the data). Generate expected outputs by running the job once
locally and copying the results — then the test pins today's behavior.

## 9. Step 7 — generate the wrappers

All generators run from the shell (for CI) or from R. Each regenerates a
deterministic artifact — commit them or regenerate at release time, but
never hand-edit them.

```bash
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' galaxy   . my-analysis --out wrappers/my_analysis.xml
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' tes      . my-analysis --out wrappers/my-analysis.tes.json
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' nextflow . my-analysis --out wrappers/my_analysis.nf
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' wdl      . my-analysis --out wrappers/my_analysis.wdl
Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' manifest . --out wrappers/manifest.json
```

### Galaxy

Complete tool XML: typed params, sanitizers and validators, outputs with
datatypes and labels, tests, citations, a `bioconductor` xref, and bioconda
requirements that Galaxy resolves to conda envs or BioContainers. Tool
version follows IUC convention with your package version leading
(`1.52.0+biocjobs1.0.0`), so regeneration after a Bioconductor release
yields a new tool version automatically. Test data is staged beside the
XML. Check it with `planemo lint` / `planemo test`; the DESeq2 artifact
validates against Galaxy's official XSD.

### GA4GH TES

A TES v1.1 task template, schema-valid for `POST /tasks`. Inputs/outputs
are staged at fixed container paths; unknown-at-generation-time values are
`{{...}}` placeholders and the task is tagged `biocjobs.template: "true"`.
Submission tooling fills the placeholders; if an unfilled placeholder ever
reaches a run, `jobParams()` rejects it by name. On the generic
Bioconductor image, a bootstrap executor installs your package, BiocJobs,
and `depends` at task start; with a purpose-built `container:` the
bootstrap disappears.

### Nextflow

A DSL2 module: one `process`, file inputs as `path`, options as `val`
(annotated with types/defaults from the spec), outputs under stable
`emit:` names, resource directives, and a `stub:` block so pipelines can
be smoke-tested with `-stub-run` before touching real data. Use it like
any module:

```nextflow
include { MY_ANALYSIS } from './modules/my_analysis.nf'

workflow {
    MY_ANALYSIS(
        channel.fromPath(params.input1),
        'fast', 0.05)                     // options, in declared order
    MY_ANALYSIS.out.output1.view()
}
```

The DESeq2 module passes `nextflow lint` with zero warnings and executes
under `-stub-run` (verified with Nextflow 26.04, and the rendered script
block is valid bash).

Two things to know about the generated module: process inputs are
**positional** (Nextflow has no named process-input syntax), so the calling
workflow must pass the file inputs and then every option, in the order they
appear in the specification — reordering options in a future spec version
changes the call signature, so bump the job `version:` when you do.  Each
option is a required `val` with no in-module default (its spec default is
shown in a comment); supply all of them, typically wired to `params.*` in
your pipeline config.

### WDL

A WDL 1.0 task: `File` inputs, typed inputs with defaults (absent default
= required, enforced by WDL itself), outputs collected from the working
directory, `runtime` from resources, and `parameter_meta` carrying labels,
help, choices, and bounds. The DESeq2 task passes `miniwdl check`. Import
it from a workflow:

```wdl
import "my_analysis.wdl" as jobs

workflow analyze {
    call jobs.my_analysis { input: input1 = input_file, method = "fast" }
}
```

### Manifest

One JSON per package enumerating every job with its full typed interface,
resources, container, and canonical commands. This is the aggregation
unit: Bioconductor build infrastructure can collect manifests across all
packages — from tarballs, without executing any package code — into a
release-wide registry from which all of the above regenerate.

## 10. Step 8 — a command line via BiocExecute (optional)

[BiocExecute](https://github.com/BiocCodingCollaborations/BiocExecute)
(with the `feat/biocjobs-specs` branch) turns the same declarations into a
human-facing CLI — **you write nothing extra**. In your package source:

```r
BiocExecute::execCompile()      # reads inst/biocjobs/, writes exec/<Package>.R
```

Each job becomes a subcommand of one Rapp application named after your
package. After the package is installed, users put the launcher on their
PATH once:

```r
BiocExecute::execInstall("mypackage")
```

and then, at any shell:

```
$ DESeq2 --help
Usage: DESeq2 <COMMAND>
Commands:
  deseq2-differential-expression  DESeq2 differential expression

$ DESeq2 deseq2-differential-expression \
      --counts counts.tsv --coldata coldata.tsv \
      --contrast_factor condition --contrast_numerator treated \
      --contrast_denominator control --alpha 0.05
...
significant genes at padj < 0.05: 43
```

`--help` text, option types, and defaults all come from your YAML. At run
time the subcommand hands the parsed values to
`BiocJobs::execJob(values = ...)`, so the *same* validation that guards
Galaxy and TES runs guards the CLI: required options, choice membership,
bounds, and file existence are enforced by the specification, with the
same error messages.

Commit the compiled `exec/<Package>.R` like any generated artifact and
re-run `execCompile()` when specs change. Add `BiocJobs` (and optionally
`BiocExecute`) to your `Suggests:`.

## 11. Release checklist

- [ ] `Rscript -e 'BiocJobs::biocjobsCLI()' validate .` exits 0, ideally in CI
- [ ] Job runs end-to-end locally on the committed test data
- [ ] Failure paths produce single, clear error lines
- [ ] `version:` bumped if the interface or behavior changed
- [ ] Artifacts regenerated (`galaxy`, `tes`, `nextflow`, `wdl`, `manifest`,
      and `execCompile()` if you ship a CLI)
- [ ] Generated Galaxy XML passes `planemo lint`, WDL passes
      `miniwdl check`, Nextflow module passes `nextflow lint`
- [ ] `DESCRIPTION` has `Suggests: BiocJobs`
- [ ] Test data is small, deterministic (fixed seed), and its generator
      script is committed
- [ ] Regenerated artifacts are committed together with the change.
      Generated files record the BiocJobs version that produced them, so
      upgrading BiocJobs makes committed artifacts stale; regenerate and
      commit them in the same change (BiocJobs' own CI enforces this for
      the DESeq2 example)

## 12. Containers

A job needs three things at runtime: R, your package (plus `depends`), and
BiocJobs. The generated artifacts default to
`bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:<current release>` — universal, with the
TES bootstrap installing what's missing at task start (binary installs,
reasonably fast). For production or heavy use, build a purpose-built image
and set `container:` in the spec:

```dockerfile
FROM bioconductor/bioconductor_docker:RELEASE_3_23
RUN Rscript -e 'BiocManager::install(c("BiocJobs", "mypackage", "apeglm"), \
                update = FALSE, ask = FALSE)'
```

For Galaxy, requirements are bioconda packages (`bioconductor-<name>`),
which bioconda generates automatically for every Bioconductor package —
including, once accepted, BiocJobs itself.

## 13. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `package 'X' is not installed or ships no biocjobs/ directory` | Your package isn't installed and `BIOCJOBS_SPEC` isn't set. `runJob()` and the CLI `run` command set it for you; when invoking a script directly during development, `export BIOCJOBS_SPEC=inst/biocjobs/<job>.yaml`. |
| `unknown parameter(s): --foo` | Flag not declared in the spec. The error lists every declared flag. |
| `option --x: 'y' is not one of: ...` | Value outside `choices`. Fix the caller, or extend `choices`. |
| `missing required input --counts` | Required input not supplied — inputs are required unless `required: false`. |
| `unfilled template placeholder(s): --contrast_factor {{options.contrast_factor}}` | A TES template was submitted without filling its placeholders. |
| `declared output(s) not produced: results` | Script exited 0 but didn't write an output. Write every declared output or fail loudly. |
| `invalid job specification ... needs either a 'default' or 'required: true'` | Every option must be resolvable: give it a default or mark it required. |
| Galaxy strips `~` from my formula option | Declare `allow_chars: ["~"]` on that option and regenerate. |
| `'name' cannot be exposed as a CLI subcommand` (note) | The name maps to an invalid R identifier (e.g. a reserved word). Rename the job if you want a CLI. |
| Generated Galaxy test can't find files | Test file paths are relative to the package root and must exist at generation time; the generator stages them next to the XML. |

## 14. FAQ

**My package is interactive — should I force a job anyway?** No. Jobs are
for batch-shaped work. If some core computation *inside* the interactive
flow is batch-shaped (fit a model, score a matrix), consider exposing just
that.

**Can one package declare several jobs?** Yes — one YAML + script pair per
job. Names share a namespace within the package.

**Multiple files per input? Collections?** Not in spec 1.0. Workarounds:
accept an archive (`format: tar`, `tar.gz` or `zip` — all in
`jobFormats()` — and unpack it in the script) or a directory-listing TSV. Multi-file inputs are on the roadmap.

**Where do defaults live — spec or script?** Spec, always. The script must
not re-default anything; the generated UIs show the spec's defaults, and a
script that overrides them silently lies to users.

**What R version / dependencies does the spec assume?** Whatever your
package declares. Generators pin the container to a Bioconductor release;
the spec's `depends` only adds runtime-loaded extras.

**Do I commit generated artifacts?** Either commit them (reviewable diffs,
consumable directly from your repo) or regenerate in CI at release time.
Never edit them by hand — they carry a generated-by header for a reason.

**How does this relate to writing a Galaxy wrapper / nf-core module by
hand?** Hand-written wrappers can be richer (conditionals, collections,
`ext.args`). Generated ones are consistent, always in sync with the
package, and exist for the long tail of packages nobody wraps by hand. If
a community later hand-tunes a wrapper, the generated one still serves as
the tested baseline.
